This repository gives detailed work on my learnings  in Power BI.
## Data Cleaning.
 The whole data cleaning exercise was carried out using the Power BI software, and the data sets used were the following:
* Columnar Data
* Trim and clean.
   * For the columnar data, the initial promoted headers were removed, then the table was transposed, moving the cities from the different rows to a particular column. To fill the null values in the row with cities, we used the Fill Down option. Then we used the first row as a header. After doing that, I selected the first two columns and unpivoted the other columns. Then I renamed the columns and did the sum of the products by groups. This is maximising data performance
